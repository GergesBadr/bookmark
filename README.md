# Bookmark-landing-page

Welcome to my first Tailwindcss project! this website is a challenge from [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158/hub).
I have added some other stuff and didn't make the design as it is, so have a look to the design and compare it with the website.


## ğŸ“Œ Features

- Fully responsive
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Accessible
- Interactive
- Nice and simple UI


## ğŸ’» Lessons Learned

Although it might seem a small project, yet I learned from it alot. Here are some:
- Accessibility. I searched and learned lots of things about accessibility becaues of this project. and it's still an onging process.  
- Tailwind itself! It makes me understand how to deal with the framework deeply.
- The time. I challenged myself to finish it in two days, and I did so.
- I learned how to write a README file like this one!
